        <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <div class="description">
                <p> I want to explore how neural networks can be used to generate music. The project will take particular genre(s) of music and train a neural network to generate
                    its own music files that hopefully captures "elements" of the genre. By elements of the genre I mean melodic patterns, harmonies, textures, etc that appear in
                    different genres of music that make them recognizable as being in that genre. The idea isn't necessarily to emulate real compositions or have the music sound 
                    "human-like" but just to see of the generated music is somewhat recognizable as being in that genre. This could provide a new (non-rigourous) angle for
                    analysing music by observing what patterns the neural network learns.
                </p>
