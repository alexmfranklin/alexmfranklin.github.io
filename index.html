        <h2>Neural Networks Introduction and Related Works</h2>
        <h3>An ethical investigation into Spotify recommendations</h3> 
          <p>Becky Zhang and Alex Franklin | March 17, 2021</p>
          
          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p> 
              Much of our consumption of music today is dictated by the algorithms and models behind streaming services. The architecture of these models, whose 
              recommendations are impacted by their user data and strategic aims, holds real-life implications on which music ends up being played. To investigate 
              these effects, we need to understand the models used by Spotify, the kinds of data they collect, and how they use it to inform their recommendations.
